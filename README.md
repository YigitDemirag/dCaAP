### Pytorch implementation of `Dendritic action potentials and computation in human layer 2/3 cortical neurons. Science,2020`


- dCaAP is a result of a nonlinear function that can be interpreted as anti-coincidence(XOR) detector. 
- Complex apical dendrite dynamics alone can solve XOR task, ReLU can't solve it.
